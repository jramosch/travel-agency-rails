## Travel Agency Rails Description

My Rails portfolio project functions as a virtual travel agency in which users can create accounts, browse locations, and take trips which impact a user's travel credits, energy, and fun. Admin users have the ability to create and edit locations, while editing account details for users. Users also have the option of signing in with their Google account, skipping over the sign up option.

## Start Up Instructions

1. Using the terminal from the project's parent directory, run `bundle install` and `rake db:migrate` to set up the program
2. Seed the database with the command `rake db:seed`
3. Launch a local server using `rails s`
4. Using your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000
5. Begin with signing up with an account or singing in with a Google account
